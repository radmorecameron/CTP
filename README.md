<p>
    <b>The Heritage College Code testing platform was created to enhance the flow of both teacher's and student's when testing code against activities in class at Heritage College.</b>
    <br /><br />
    Students can upload a code file that gets compiled against test cases and receive results back from it.
    <br />
    Teachers can create new activities for their students.
    Teachers can create test cases for these activites that will be run against the student's code.
